# League Table

## Overview

The task consists of an hour of pair programming on a simple program for reading football league table data, and printing some metrics regarding that league table data.

In this scenario you have another developer to pair with, and you should treat them as just another developer you work with. This means you can discuss the work with them, and indeed swap places with them as necessary.

You also have a product owner who will accept stories and give you additional requirements as we progress through the hour.

The idea of this is to program as you would in a real world environment. As such speed is not of the highest priority, and you should test and refactor as you normally would when developing.

The emphasis should be on creating an agile code base that can quickly respond to changing business requirements, rather than getting bogged down in specific implementation details.

## Rules

* Must use the provided Visual Studio solution as a starting point.
* Must use Visual Studio as the IDE.
* Free to use Google to look up any API documentation.
* Free to use any third-party libraries if required.
* Free to add/edit/remove Visual Studio projects as required.
* You may ask the Product Owner any questions in order to clarify the requirements.
* Don't worry about completing all of the requirements in the time limit. It's better to have one requirement solved that meets the definition of done, rather than many that don't meet the definition of done.
